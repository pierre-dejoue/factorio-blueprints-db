There is No Spoon! Factorio
==========================

Yellow belts all the way.
No bots in my case.

Starter base and rocket base should be close together : lots of going back and forth ! Smelting can be further away (build once and forget) 

Power: 40 boilers + 1 dedicated belt of coal.

Iron: 2 lines
Copper: 3 lines
Steel: 1 line. Buffer a ton: The end of the run (purple science) needs a lot of steel.

Rocket Silo:
- 1k concrete: don't forget it! One assembling machine setup early is enough. 
- 1k steel: from buffer
- 200 red engines: from bot line.
- 4x prod modules lvl 3

Rocket parts:
- Fuel: Produce 1k in the oil refinery area, then transport
- Low Density Struct: Reuse yellow science line to get 1k
- Control Unit: Slow grind at the end. Needs lots of red and blue circuits...
